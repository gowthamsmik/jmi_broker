                                    Trading in such instruments can lead to large losses as well as gains in response to

                                    liquidate your position at a loss and you would be liable for any resulting loss.
                                    You may sustain substantial losses on a contract or trade if the market conditions
                                    move against your position. It is in your interest to fully understand the impact of
                                    market movements, in particular the extent of profit/loss you would be exposed to
                                    when there is an upward or down ward movement in the relevant rates and the extent
                                    of loss if you have to liquidate a position, if market conditions move against you.

                                <p class="left">Under certain market conditions you may find it difficult or impossible
                                    to liquidate a position, to assess a fair price or assess risk exposure. This can
                                    happen, for example, where the market for a transaction is illiquid or where there
                                    is a failure in electronic or telecommunications systems, or where there is the
                                    occurrence of an event commonly known as “force majeure”. Placing contingent orders,
                                    such as “stop-loss” orders, will not necessarily limit your losses to the intended
                                    amounts, as it may be impossible to execute such orders under certain market
                                    conditions.
                                    When placing a stop order or stop loss order, you must be aware that in certain
                                    market conditions you may be filled at a different price than initially requested.
                                    Because the prices and characteristics of over-the-counter transactions are
                                    individually negotiated and there is no central source for obtaining prices, there
                                    are in efficiencies in transaction pricing.
                                    We consequently cannot and do not warrant that our prices or the prices we secure
                                </p>
