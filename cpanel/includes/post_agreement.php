<h5 class="boldText">JMI Brokers LTD is licensed broker from Vanuatu Financial Services Commission as Dealers in Securities under license number 15010</h5>
<h5 class="blue">Risk Disclosure Statement<h5>
<p class="big">Before engaging in the products offered by JMI Brokers LTD you should be aware of the risks
which may be involved in trading financial contracts for differences CFDs:
</p>


<p class="blue">You should not enter into a transaction unless you fully understand:</p>

<p>
The nature and fundamentals of the transaction and the market underlying such transactions. <br />
• The extent of  the economic risk to which you are exposed as a result of such transactions(and determine that such risk is
suitable for you in light of your specific experience in relation to the transaction and your financial objectives,
circumstances and resources). <br />
• The legal terms and conditions for such transactions. You have the responsibility
to fully understand the terms and conditions of the transactions to be undertaken, including, without limitation:<br />
1. The terms as to price, term, and expiration date, restrictions on exercising an OTC and the terms material
to the transaction. <br />
2. Any terms describing risk factors, such as volatility, liquidity,
and so on. <br />
3. The circumstances under which you may become obliged to make or take delivery of a Leveraged
foreign exchange transaction or Futures contracts.<br />
 The high degree of leverage that is often obtainable in
trading of the products offered by JMI Brokers LTD can work against you as well as for you, due to fluctuating
market conditions.<br />
 Trading in such instruments can lead to large losses as well as gains in response
to a small market movement. If the market moves against you, you may not only sustain a total loss of your
initial margin deposit, and any additional funds deposited with JMI Brokers LTD. to maintain your position,
but you may also incur further liability to JMI Brokers LTD. You may be called upon to “top-up” your margin by
substantial amounts at short notice to maintain your position, failing which JMI Brokers LTD may have to
liquidate your position at a loss and you would be liable for any resulting loss. You may sustain substantial
losses on a contract or trade if the market conditions move against your position. It is in your interest to fully
understand the impact of market movements, in particular the extent of profit/loss you would be exposed to
when there is an upward or down ward movement in the relevant rates and the extent of loss if you have to
liquidate a position, if market conditions move against you. Under certain market conditions you may find it
difficult or impossible to liquidate a position, to assess a fair price or assess risk exposure. This can happen, for
example, where the market for a transaction is illiquid or where there is a failure in electronic or
telecommunications systems, or where there is the occurrence of an event commonly known as “force majeure”.
Placing contingent orders, such as “stop-loss” orders, will not necessarily limit your losses to the intended
amounts, as it may be impossible to execute such orders under certain market conditions.<br />
When placing a stop
order or stop loss order, you must be aware that in certain market conditions you may be filled at a different
price than initially requested. Because the prices and characteristics of over-the-counter transactions are
individually negotiated and there is no central source for obtaining prices, there are in efficiencies in
transaction pricing.<br />
 We consequently cannot and do not warrant that our prices or the prices we secure
